        This is an effort to provide a platform to the farmers of our nation to
        be able to sell their produce online, hence cutting out middlemen and 
        increasing their income. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Buyers pan-India, be it individual consumers or corporations can buy crops
        from all across India, creating India's first truly nationwide agriculture platform.
        </p>

            Since our platform is farmer centric, we also provide diagnostic tools
            to farmers through which they can take well informed, intelligent decisions
            on when to sell their crop in the marketplace. This helps them decide on
            investments in cold storage solutions and assists in maximizing overall profits.
